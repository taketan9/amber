//! Replace across the files a grep found — the bulk half of `:s`.
//!
//! Sakura Editor's grep-replace is the feature this exists for: grep a tree,
//! look at what came back, and change it everywhere in one pass. The dangerous
//! part is not the matching, it is that a bulk write has no undo, so the rules
//! here are all about being able to look before leaping:
//!
//! * [`plan`] only reads. It hands back every line it would change, with the
//!   before and after text, so the caller can show them and let the user
//!   uncheck the ones it got wrong. Nothing is written until [`apply`].
//! * [`apply`] re-reads each file and refuses any line whose text no longer
//!   matches what the plan showed. Between planning and applying, a log file
//!   can grow and an editor can save; writing a line number computed against
//!   an older copy of the file is how bulk tools eat data.
//! * A file that cannot be round-tripped losslessly is refused rather than
//!   rewritten. Being told "3 files skipped, here is why" is recoverable;
//!   discovering later that a binary was mangled is not.
//!
//! It also owns its own read and write rather than borrowing the F3 viewer's,
//! because the viewer expands tabs for display. That is right for looking at a
//! file and wrong for writing one back.
